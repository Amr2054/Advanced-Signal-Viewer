## ️ **Core Features**

###  Signal Viewers

| Viewer | Domain | Visualization Modes | AI Capabilities |
|:-------|:--------|:--------------------|:----------------|
| **ECG Viewer** | Medical | Standard, Polar, XOR, Recurrence | Cardiac abnormality detection |
| **EEG Viewer** | Medical | Standard, Polar, XOR, Recurrence | Neurological signal classification |
| **Doppler Viewer** | Acoustic / Physics | Custom frequency-based views | Car sound detection & Doppler frequency synthesis |
| **SAR-Drone Viewer** | Remote Sensing | Custom SAR & drone signal views | Earthquake detection (SAR) & drone sound recognition |

---

##  **Viewing Modes**

| Mode | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Standard View** | Traditional time-domain visualization of the raw signal. |
| **Polar View** | Polar coordinate representation for revealing hidden periodicity and patterns. |
| **XOR View** | Highlights signal differences via XOR operations to expose subtle pattern changes. |
| **Recurrence View** | Recurrence plots for detecting repeating or chaotic dynamics in signals. |
