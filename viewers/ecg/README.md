## Visualization Modes

### 1. **Static Mode**

**Description**: Traditional multi-lead ECG strip display

**Features**:
- Displays selected leads in stacked format
- Fixed time window (configurable duration)
- Clear grid overlay for precise measurements
- Time-aligned view of all selected leads

**Best For**:
- Initial ECG review
- Print-ready views
- Standard clinical interpretation
- Rhythm analysis across multiple leads


---

### 2. **Continuous Mode**

**Description**: Dynamic scrolling ECG viewer with VCR-like controls

**Features**:
- Smooth horizontal scrolling through the entire recording
- Adjustable playback speed (0.1x - 5.0x)
- Variable zoom levels (1s - 30s windows)
- Pan left/right for manual navigation
- Real-time position indicator

**Controls**:
- **‚ñ∂ Play/‚è∏ Pause**: Start/stop automatic scrolling
- **‚èÆ Reset**: Jump to beginning
- **‚óÄ Pan Left**: Manual backward navigation
- **‚ñ∂ Pan Right**: Manual forward navigation
- **Speed Slider**: 0.1x to 5.0x playback speed
- **Zoom Slider**: 1s to 30s viewing window
- **Position Slider**: Direct jump to any time point

**Best For**:
- Reviewing long recordings
- Finding specific events in the signal
- Teaching and demonstrations
- Detailed rhythm analysis

---

### 3. **XOR Chunks Mode**

**Description**: Advanced temporal analysis comparing consecutive time segments

**Features**:
- Divides signal into equal time chunks
- Compares consecutive chunks using XOR logic
- Highlights differences between adjacent segments
- Threshold-based difference detection

**How It Works**:
- Signal divided into chunks of specified period
- Each chunk compared with the next
- Differences above threshold are displayed
- Empty result = chunks match (periodic signal)

**Controls**:
- **Channel Selection**: Choose single lead to analyze
- **Chunk Period**: 0.2s - 5.0s (duration of each segment)
- **Threshold**: 0.01 - 0.5 mV (sensitivity for detecting differences)

**Best For**:
- Detecting rhythm irregularities
- Finding periodic patterns
- Identifying signal consistency
- Arrhythmia analysis

**Interpretation**:
- **Points shown**: Chunks differ (irregular rhythm)
- **Empty plot**: All chunks match (regular rhythm)

### 4. **Polar Mode**

**Description**: Circular representation mapping amplitude and time to polar coordinates

**Features**:
- **Dual View Display**:
  - **Top**: Polar graph (r = magnitude, Œ∏ = time)
  - **Bottom**: Synchronized time domain view
- **Two Display Modes**:
  - **Latest**: Shows only current window
  - **Cumulative**: Accumulates historical data with fading effect
- Animated playback with position tracking
- Color-coded magnitude visualization

**Polar Coordinates**:
- **r (radius)**: Absolute amplitude magnitude |signal|
- **Œ∏ (angle)**: Time mapped to 0¬∞ - 360¬∞

**Controls**:
- **Channel Selection**: Single lead analysis
- **Window Size**: 1s - 20s viewing window
- **Display Mode**: Latest vs. Cumulative
- **‚ñ∂ Play/‚è∏ Pause**: Animate through recording
- **‚èÆ Reset**: Clear cumulative data and restart

**Best For**:
- Visualizing signal periodicity
- Pattern recognition in circular space
- Educational demonstrations
- Alternative perspective on rhythm

**Unique Features**:
- Synchronized dual-view (polar + time domain)
- Real-time comparison between coordinate systems
- Visual pattern emergence in circular representation

### 5. **Cross Recurrence**

**Description**: 2D phase space recurrence plot comparing two leads

**Features**:
- Plots two leads against each other (X vs Y)
- Color-coded occurrence frequency
- Grid-based binning for pattern detection
- Multiple colormap options

**How It Works**:
- Each sample plotted as (Lead X, Lead Y) coordinate
- Points binned by amplitude resolution
- Color intensity = frequency of occurrence
- Reveals relationships between leads

**Controls**:
- **X-axis Lead**: First lead selection
- **Y-axis Lead**: Second lead selection
- **Resolution**: 0.01 - 0.5 mV (grid bin size)
- **Colormap**: 
  - Viridis (default)
  - Plasma
  - Turbo
  - And more...

**Best For**:
- Lead relationship analysis
- Detecting correlated patterns


**Interpretation**:
- **Tight clusters**: Strong correlation between leads
- **Scattered points**: Weak correlation
- **Diagonal patterns**: Similar signal characteristics
- **Color intensity**: Recurrence frequency
